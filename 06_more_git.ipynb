    "I'm going to update the occasionally, so I need to explain how to update your local copy of the code to match what I have here. In general, it's easiest to interact with git through the terminal. There are programming tools you can use that might make it easier, but it's really useful if you do any programming to understand it. One starting point I like to help grok git is this [parable](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html). It's a little long and you don't have to read it all now, but it might help you the reasons behind the design of the system, which is a great way to understand how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Really, that's true for a lot of things in life, not just for programming but, say, biology and evolution, that understanding the reasons behind why something is the way it is is the best way to understand the system."

    "Anyway, the way git works is that all git command-line tools start with `git` followed by a command (like `clone` that you used when you first cloned the repo) followed by some additional options and arguments. I'd like to say the commands are all logical and well organized, but some are a little confusing and not totally consistent, I think because the commands were changed as it was being created.\n",
