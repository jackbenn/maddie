# Introduction to Python

Hi Maddie!

Here's some stuff to get you started programming in python, in a bunch of notebooks. To get started, open up the [first one](01_setup.ipynb).

Let me know if you get stuck at any point.

This is all meant to be interactive; you should follow along with the instructions as you read it. Just reading it isn't going to do much good at all. You are strongly encouraged to experiment and try a little more than what I suggest.

I'm not sure what you know right now, so I'm not assuming much other than you can figure things out.
